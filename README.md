Data from the sunk ship titanic is hereby being used to train models and also test them to make predictions.Later on my predictions will be cheked by kaggle to see their level of accuracy.
Titanic dataset is an open dataset used in machine learning and since the data will never change it is therefore improved on a daily basis by developers allover the world trying to investigate the factors that would have led to survival of passangers using a macine learning model.
